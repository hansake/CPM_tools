# Cyput sends multiple files using YMODEM protocol

The cyput (and hopefully later cyget) program can
transfer files from and to CP/M computers using
the YMODEM protocol.

Currently the program is working on a Zendex
Model 835 CP/M system.

The program tmrtst is used to determine the number
of program loops the get the correct timeout
for the serial recieve channal.
