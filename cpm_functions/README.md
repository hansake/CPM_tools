# CP/M and BDOS related functions

The function searchf() expands wildcard filenames.

This directory also contains the submit files for CP/M-80 and CP/M-86 to compile the source files.

Note that the source files must end with Ctrl-Z to indicate end of file,
otherwise the compiler will complain. (There might be junk characters after Ctrl-Z.)
