# CPM_tools
CP/M tools written in C

This reporitory contains some software tools for CP/M-80 and CP/M-86.
These tools are written in C and compiled with Whitesmiths C compiler version 2.2.

CP/M functions that are used by several tools are in the cpm_functions directory.

The program "cless" is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.

The program "cyput" transfer files from a CP/M system using the YMODEM protocol.

Hopefully there will also be a "cyget" program also that transfer files in the other direction.

Maybe more tools to come ...
